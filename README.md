# FunParenthMatchLL

### Interactive Checking for Balanced Parenthesis on Infix Problems using Linked List Stack

FunParenthMatchLL was developed in c language to demonstrate how to check pesky infix problems to ensure their parenthesis are balanced. Useful algorithm for long equations, compilers usually do this automagically behind the scenes.

- Choose from 10 postfix equations
- Check whether those parenthesis are balanced!
- Go have a sandwich, knowing with confidence this infix will compute!
